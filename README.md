A repository to archive projects done for the HarvardX: CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript online course.

All of these projects are meant to be mounted and hosted on the Django framework.

Project 1: Wiki is meant to simulate a Wikipedia-like database where users can search and pull web pages which may also link and redirect to each other.
Project 2: Search is meant to simulate a search engine framework which allows for advanced filters to refine searches.
Project 3: Network is a simulation of a social network framework where users can have personlised pages and add each other as contacts. There is also the function of publishing posts and interacting with them through likes and comments.
Project 4: Mail is, as aptly named, an email framework which allows users to compose and send mail objects to each other's mailboxes.
Project 5: Commerce is a shopping platform framework where users can create postings to sell items, and of course buy from these postings. There is also an ebay inspired bidding system.
Project 6: Capstone is meant to be an Interactive Fiction reader which aims to standardise all the current available formats. More information can be found in the readme file in the folder.
